## Trees

- **Tree:** Data structure composed of nodes
  - Each tree has a root node (not a requirement in graph theory)
  - Root node has child nodes, and each child node has zero or more child nodes.

## Treres vs Binary Trees vs Binary Search Trees

- **Tree:** Each node can have **any** number of children
- **Binary Tree:** Each node can have **upto two** children
- **Binary Search Tree:** all left descrndents <= n < all right descendents
  - This must be true for all nodes _n_
  - NOTE: It must hold true for all of a _nodes descendents_
- **Balanced vs. Unbalanced:**
- **Complete Binary Trees:** Every level of the tree is fully filled, except for the last level.
- **Full Binary Trees:** Every node has zero or two children.
  - No nodes have only one child.
- **Perfect Binary Trees:**
  - A binary tree that is both full and complete.
  - All leaf nodes will be at the same level (and has the max # of nodes)
